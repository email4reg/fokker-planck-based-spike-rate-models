spectral solver:

calculate_quantities_spectral.py
    - the first two DOMINANT eigenvalues are always extracted from lambda_all -> lambda_1 and lambda_2
    - additionally we extract all available diffusive and regular eigenvalues and chose which
    (or rather how many [nr_reg, nr_diff]) we use finally to compute the corresponding quantities. These
    are stored in lambda_reg_diff -> quantities_dict!
    -  postprocess_quantities was adapted for the new storing scheme (eg. f_1, f_2 -> f)
    - plotting code was adapted to new storing scheme

models:
    - implement/debug the spec3 models

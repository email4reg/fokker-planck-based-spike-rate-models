spectral solver:

calculate_quantities_spectral.py
    - the first two DOMINANT eigenvalues are always extracted from lambda_all -> lambda_1 and lambda_2 (in postprocess spectrum)
    - additionally we extract all available diffusive and regular eigenvalues and chose which
    (or rather how many [nr_reg, nr_diff]) we use finally to compute the corresponding quantities. These
    are stored in lambda_reg_diff -> quantities_dict!

    - go through the reg_diff extracting functions
    - postprocess_quantities was adapted for the new storing scheme (eg. f_1, f_2 -> f)
    - plotting code was adapted to new quantitiy-storing scheme

models:
    - spec3: implement/debug
    - spec2: now runnable with two different files -> scheme 'dom' for dominant modes, 'reg' for regular modes

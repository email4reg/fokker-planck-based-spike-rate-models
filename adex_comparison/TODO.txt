Moritz:
* ensure that preclac here works after renaming everything
* then clean spectralsolver code
* add ipython notebooks for better relation to paper? (see spectral_todo folder)

Fabian:
* make example scripts for situations as in fig1 and fig5 (e.g., runmodels.py runmodels_fig1.py / runmodels_fig5a.py / runmodels_fig5b.py)?

All:
